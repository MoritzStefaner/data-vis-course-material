{"name":"Data-vis-course-material","tagline":"","body":"#Data Visualisation and Information Graphics\r\nVisual depictions are a tremendously important, but often neglected, tool in scientific practice and communication. In a four-day workshop, Moritz Stefaner, a well-known expert in the field of data visualization, will provide practical tips and guidance in how to use data visualization most effectively in your scientific practice. Among others, we will learn about the pros and cons of different diagram types, the best use of visual variables, tips for working with colors, icons, and typography, layout tricks and the role of narrative techniques. Our practical focus will lie on the production of print graphics for publications and posters, but we will also discuss the production of interactive web-based visuals. Participants are expected to attend all sessions and produce a practical project in order to receive a certificate for the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#PAST LECTURE MATERIALS\r\n\r\n*bernstein center: data visualization\r\n\tday 1\r\n\tday 2\r\n\r\n*hochschule fuer kuenste bremen: weltbilder\r\n[Course Homepage](https://hfk-bremen.incom.org/workspace/17 \"This course was held in Mach 2013\")\r\n\tinfo\r\n\tprojects\r\n\tbasics\r\n\thistory \r\n\tthe horror\r\n\ttheme and reference projects\r\n\tdiagram types - networks, trees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#CONTENT & FORM\r\n\r\n*\"Critical InfoVis: Exploring the Politics of Visualization\"\r\n\r\n*aesthetics in information visualization: \"On the role of design in information visualization\"\r\n\r\n*Better memory based on embellished pics:\"Useful Junk?
